<h1 align=center >Abstract</h1>
Contrast measurements of interference patterns emerging from the surface can be used to
evaluate the three dimensional shape of an object. Traditionally, moving the focal plane through
the object involves a mechanical movement in the imaging system. In my thesis, I show that a
spatial light modulator (SLM) utilizing the transfer function of propagation can move the focal
plane with no reduction in image quality and without the need for any mechanical movement. The
SLM is integrated in the Fourier plane of a 4f imaging system. The speckle patterns (interference
patterns) play a central role in the evaluation process of the three dimensional measurement.
I report my findings from a simulation, which relate the size of the speckle to the wavelength
of light used as illumination, the size of the Fourier aperture and the focal length of the utilized
lenses in the 4f setup. A method for speckle size detection is presented. For partially coherent
light, a predictable area of high contrast forms around the objects’ surface, with the rest of
the wave field being of lower contrast. The simulated results are supported by experimental
evidence. I experimentally demonstrate a visible difference in contrast and image sharpness for
microscopic surface features of different height. This paves the road for the development of a
fully functional measuring method that is precise, fast, robust against vibrations and exhibits an
extended depth of focus.

<b>Figure 1. Amplitude and phase of numerically simulated coherent speckle wavefield in the sensor plane.</b>  
The amplitude consists of the characteristic speckle pattern. The phase distribution shows phase singularities (e.g. red arrow) and phase jumps (e.g. yellow arrow). I generated the wavefield with 128 scattering points on a square surface of size 5.42 mm × 5.42 mm,
10 mm from the input plane, illuminated with a wavelength of λ = 530 nm. The 4f setup
consists of two f = 100 mm lenses and a Fourier aperture of diameter ρ = 0.25 mm. The
sampled area shown is 512 × 512 pixels with a pixel pitch of ∆x = 5.2 µm.

I captured the intensities at different z by varying the transfer function Hz in the Fourier domain from z = -500 mm
to z = 500 mm. I generated the wavefield with the same parameters as Figure 3. The
sampled area shown is 1024 × 1024 pixels.

An exponential function
f(I/¯I) = a/¯I exp(b · I/¯I) (blue line)
is fitted to the data (black dots). The
parameters a ≈ 1.01 and b ≈ −1.02
were determined. Both are very close
to the expected values a = 1 and b = -1.
The position of the data point at I/¯I = 0
is an artifact of the histogram calculation
algorithm. The data point is excluded
from the fit calculation.

<b>Figure 5. Numerically calculated amplitude distributions of a partially coherent wavefield at
different propagation distances. </b>  
I placed the objects’ surface at z0 = 10 mm and scanned
through the incoherent wavefield by changing the transfer function Hz on the SLM accordingly.
The contrast changes with the distance to the objects’ surface. I calculated the amplitude
distributions from 1024 scattering points on a square surface of 5.42 mm × 5.42 mm, 10 mm
from the input plane, illuminated with monochromatic light of wavelength λ = 530 nm. The
wavefield was processed through a 4f optical filter with f = 150 mm and an aperture diameter
of ρ = 1 mm. The sampled areas shown are 256 × 256 pixels with a pixel pitch of ∆x ≈ 10 um.

<h1 align=center>Conclusion</h1>
In the course of this work I investigated several aspects of a 4f setup with a spatial light modulator
in the Fourier plane. The spatial light modulator was instructed to display a phase shifting transfer
function of propagation. I studied the effect of the wavelength of light, the opening diameter of
the light source, the distance of the light source, as well as the focal length and the size of the
Fourier aperture. For coherent illumination, the size of the Speckle is affected (Figure 4, 7).
For partially coherent illumination, the area, where high contrast interference occurs, is affected
as well (Figure 6, 8).
This was examined both in a numerical simulation that I based off of Fourier optics, and in the
experimental system itself, which I set up and took into operation. In order to
address the spatial light modulator, I wrote a program that would detect and compensate misalignment between the optical axes and display the appropriate transfer function of propagation
onto the device.
